Hi! If you see this github, it either means you are interested in Machine Learning or CV, or you're one of my friends who are interested in ML. Definitely check this out on the course webpage.

So far, I've implemented:

 - Modular neural network layers
 - Various first order gradient descent methods such as momentum, nesterov momentum, adam, rmsprop and adagrad.
 - Convolutional neural networks with batch normalization and dropout

# Accuracies of Each #
---
Modular neural networks ~ 50%
Convolutional neural networks ~ 65% (Though could be much better, check out my other repo "TensorflowConvNet" for better accuracies)
