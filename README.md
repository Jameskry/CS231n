Hi! If you see this github, it either means you are interested in Machine Learning or CV, or you're one of my friends who are interested in ML. Definitely check this out [on the course webpage](http://cs231n.github.io/). 



So far, I've implemented:

kNN (k nearest neighbor), a derivation of ANN algorithm. Check it out in the knn.ipynb and classifiers folder.
