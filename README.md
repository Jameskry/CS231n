Hi! If you see this github, it either means you are interested in Machine Learning or CV, or you're one of my friends who are interested in ML. Definitely check this out [on the course webpage](http://cs231n.github.io/). 



So far, I've implemented:

kNN (k nearest neighbor), a derivation of ANN algorithm. Check it out in the knn.ipynb and classifiers folder. 

SVM (Support Vector Machine), a single layered classification algorithm that uses piece-wise linear functions from each sample to reach a "bowl" shaped cost function to minimize on for classification.

Softmax (Generalization of Logistic Regression), a single layered classification algorithm that assumes the scores(X dot W) are unormalized log distributions of the actual probability function, which is computed to get the correct classes to converge to 1 and the incorrect classes to converge to 0(the probabilities all add up to 1).
